    "Hi I am Arkaprota Ghosh.I am passionate about developing complex applications that solve real-world problems impacting millions of users",
  description: `My proficiency in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript ensures that I can build responsive, visually appealing interfaces, while my experience with React enables me to develop interactive and seamless user experiences.

  On the server side, I leverage Node.js and Express.js to create scalable and efficient APIs, paired with MongoDB and SQL databases to manage and store data securely and effectively. My expertise extends to the MUI Library, where I design interfaces that not only look great but also enhance usability.

  I am also skilled in AB Testing, which allows me to make data-driven decisions that improve application performance and user satisfaction. This combination of technical expertise and analytical thinking ensures that the solutions I deliver are not only functional but also optimized for real-world use.

  Beyond my technical skills, I am a problem solver at heart, always eager to take on new challenges and learn from them. Whether youâ€™re looking for someone who can dive deep into complex coding problems or communicate effectively with non-technical stakeholders, I am committed to bridging the gap between technology and people, delivering solutions that truly make an impact.`,
